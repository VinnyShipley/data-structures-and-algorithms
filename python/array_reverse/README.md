# Reverse an Array

The challenge of the code challenge today was to whiteboard out an algorithm that takes in an array, and returns a reversed array

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

Big(O) for time would be O(N) because the time it takes to process the list goes up in a linear relationship to how big the input list is.

Big(O) for space would also be O(N) because the output will always be the same length as the input list.

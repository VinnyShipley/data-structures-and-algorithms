# Stacks and Queues

Stacks are a FiLo system of storing data (first in last out), while queues are a FiFo  system (first in first out)

## Challenge

Create a class for both stacks and queues that include the required methods

## Approach & Efficiency

The methods built here all operate on a O(1) for space, as he methods will only ever increase or decrease the length of the list by one node at the largest.

For time it is also O(1) due to the fact that the methods built here will only ever be able to add or subtract one node from the list, meaning it will only ever be one set amount of time to pop off or append the node to the list at the longest
